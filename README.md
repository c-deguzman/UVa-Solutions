# UVa-Solutions
I am currently working through Competitive Programming, 3rd Edition by Steven Halim.
This is a small collection of my solutions to UVa problems suggested by the textbook.
All solutions are written in C++.

Sample Topics Covered:
- Bit Manipulation
- Union-Find Disjoint Set
- Segement Tree
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursive Backtracking
- Binary Search
- Greedy
- Topological Sorting
- Articulation Points
- Strongly Connected Components (Tarjan)
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Shortest Path (Dijkstra, SPFA)
- Max Flow (Edmonds-Karp)


Recommended Problems to Try:
 - 12356 - Army Buddies        (array thinking problem)
 - 11572 - Unique Snowflakes   (map thinking problem)
 - 11235 - Frequent values     (segment tree thinking problem)
 - 11402 - Ahoy, Pirates!      (segment tree with lazy propagation)
 - 11553 - Grid Game           (bitmask dynamic programming with basic game theory)
 - 193 - Graph Coloring        (maxium independent set - recursive backtracking)
 - 1262 - Password             (ad hoc - thinking)
 - 183 - Bit Maps              (divide and conquer)
 - 10718 - Bit Mask            (greedy, bit manipulation - thinking problem)
 - 12047 - Highest Paid Toll   (multi-part shortest path problem)
 - 11506 - Angry Programmer    (undirected min cut / max flow problem with vertex capacities)
 - 10459 - The Tree Root       (tree diameter problem)
